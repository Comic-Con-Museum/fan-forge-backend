# Contributing

There are three main ways to contribute. Feel free to make use of any or all
of them, but please keep in mind that the developers are all volunteers. You
may get reponses slowly, or not at all.

## Bug reports

Did you find an issue somewhere in the site? Are things behaving wrong, or
looking strange, or just not doing what you expect them to? You can submit a
[bug report][gh-br-tmpl], letting us know what's going wrong.  **Please
"subscribe" to the bug report**, with the button on the right. We may need
more information from you; if you disappear, it'll be impossible to fix the
issue, and we'll close the ticket. Please also let us know if the issue fixes
itself -- we can look at what changed and try to track it down.

## Feature requests

Do you have an idea for something that should be added to the site? You should
make a [feature request][gh-fr-tmpl] and tell us what it is! We can't
guarantee that the idea will get in -- even if it fits perfectly with the
Comic-Con Museum's vision for the site, we might not have the developers or
other resources to implement it. Once you've proposed a feature request, we'll
discuss it, and proceed from there.

## Pull requests

If you know your way around Java and want to help with the actual development,
you can create a pull request. The process is a little complicated, and you'll
need to know how to use Git and GitHub.

1.  Find an issue that no one else has claimed. That means anything tagged
    [up for grabs][gh-ufg], but if it's your first PR, you might also want
    to look at [good first issues][gh-gfi].
2.  Comment on the issue's thread to claim it. Wait for a maintainer to say
    that the issue is yours before continuing.
3.  Fork the repo with the button in the top right.
4.  Create a new branch containing the number of your issue -- for example
    `29-add-hello-world`.
5.  Make your changes on that branch. Be sure to add unit tests as necessary
    to cover your new code! Do manual tests, too, to double-check.
6.  When you're done with your code, open a pull request. Be descriptive in
    the title and description, and link to the original issue.
7.  The contributors and maintainers might have some changes for you to make.
    Please make them promptly -- it helps speed everything up if we're not
    left waiting days for changes.
8.  Once everything looks good, your PR will be accepted, and the code will
    be automatically merged in and added to the next release. Congrats!
