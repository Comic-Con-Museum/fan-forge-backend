Contributing Code

Are you a developer and interested in directly making FECS better? You can
contribute code! There's a little bit of a process, to help keep things
organized, and so we can make sure people don't accidentally do the same work
twice, and so that people don't spend time on features that aren't wanted.

1.  **Look at the code** to familiarize yourself with the code style.
2.  **Pick an *existing* issue** to implement. This is "issue" in the sense of
    [GitHub Issues][gh-issues], not just the English word. You can dig through
    them all, or specifically look for [good first issues][gfi] or issues that
    represent [help wanted][hw]. Look for one with no assignee, and scroll to
    the bottom of the comments to make sure no one else has claimed it yet.
3.  **Claim it** by posting a comment. Only claim one at a time, and wait for
    a contributor to confirm the claim.
4.  **Fork the repo**.
5.  **Make your changes**. Remember to follow the styles and conventions that
    are already present in the code -- even if you think they're bad.
6.  **Open a pull request** to get your changes reviewed and, eventually,
    added.
