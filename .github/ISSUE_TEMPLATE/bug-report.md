# Expected behavior
*When you follow those steps, what should have happened, either at the end or sometime in the middle?*

# Actual behavior
*What happened instead of the expected behavior?*

# Screenshots
*If it applies, add screenshots showing what's wrong. If you can, a video would be even more helpful!*

 - What OS?
 - What browser?
 - What version of the browser?

*If the bug happens on a smartphone:*
 - What device?
 - What OS on that device?
