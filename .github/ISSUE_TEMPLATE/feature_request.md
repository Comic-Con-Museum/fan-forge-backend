name: Feature request
about: Tell us an idea you had for an improvement

---

# Goal
*A feature should have a specific goal. That is, it should be an attempt to make some specific improvement to the site. What does this feature do?*

# Description
*What does the feature you have in mind do? Explain in as much detail as you think is necessary, but give us more than just "your thing should do a thing better than it does!"*

# Alternatives
*Have you considered any alternative features which accomplish the same goal? If so, which? Why did you reject them in favor of the one you're suggesting now? This helps us avoid covering the same ground twice.*

# Additional notes
*Is there anything else we should know? Maybe a common pitfall, or an implementation idea? Add it here!*
